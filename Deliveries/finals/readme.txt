How to launch JAR:
	-SERVER: java -jar adrenalina.jar server
	-CLI:	 java -jar adrenalina.jar client cli
	-GUI:	 java -jar adrenalina.jar client gui

The duration of timers are loaded from a configuration file inside the jar
The default values are: turn timer 240sec
			            wait turn during login 30sec

For a better experience with the CLI we recommend the DejaVu Sans Mono as font, using UTF-8 as charset and enabling ANSI code for colors

What we have implemented:
	Completed Rules + CLI + GUI + Socket + RMI + 1 FA (multiple matches)
